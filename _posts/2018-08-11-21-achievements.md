# 21 Achievements while I was 21.

As I turn 22 years young, I thought of a way of which I would be able to commemorate everything that I've done in the past 12 months. It was hard to remember all of these things because I haven't really noted it down or posted some of my acheivements for the year. So, I've went ahead and compiled a post about 21 little wins I've gained while I was 21!

### 1. First developer job

Digiground was my first tech gig ever. With this job I was able to develop core skills of what it’s like to become a programmer. I’ve learned Typescript and Ionic framework in about a month and as I progressed through my internship I was able to do test driven development with an iOS device. There were a lot of barriers that I had to face, and I’ve soon realised that Ionic really limited the user experience of the app. 

### 2. Friendships

When I first started university, I was very shy and I had friends come and go. But last year, I’ve decided to sign up to volunteer with the Women in Engineering and IT team at UTS and to my surprise I was selected to speak to high school students on what my experiences were as a Women in STEM. Through programs like this, I have made new friends and gained a new job. More on the new job later. Friends that I’ve made through programs like this soon turned into best friends and we had eventually started hanging out after uni and before uni and doing assignments and homework together. I’m so blessed to call these people my friends. I feel like, to achieve more you have to be emotionally sustained with yourself. Without these friends, I wasn’t sure if I’d actually finish university. So thank you to all the friends that I’ve made in the past year, you know who you are.  

### 3. Better grades

Through the positive influence of my friends at uni, I was able to study in a group and do all of our team assignments together. This actually worked out best in our favour because we already are comfortable with each other as friends and we all wanted to achieve a good mark. Having such a supportive friendship group, we were all receiving distinction averages for the last semester. From a student who has always just aimed for a pass, this was huge for me. 

### 4. Public speaking 

Although I wished that I’ve done this more, I was able to speak about my mentoring experience through the Lucy Mentoring program and through outreach visits to schools. My ultimate goal of being a sprout was to give back to my high school of which I finished my HSC from. I was able to do just that and to this day, I still would actually go back despite hating high school so much! 

### 5. STEM activities 

Being a part of the SPROUTS team, I was given the opportunity to share my learning experiences with programming, problem solving and resiliance. By facilitating STEM related activities for high schoolers as a part of the UTS' outreach program. I didn't make any classes. but I found this a way for me to reconnect with society, giving back to the community and encouraging more young females to pursue a career in STEM.

### 6. Found hella good spots for brunch

This was no doubt the highlight of my university life. Spending hours at university studying, attending lectures and labs, is pretty exhausting. In some long breaks during the day, me and my friends would choose a nice place to have lunch at that we have never been to before. Through this, we end up finding the best place to have brunch at, the best place to have a coffee and the best place to study at. 

### 7. Mentorship

Lucy mentoring program has been life changing for me. I've continued my mentorship from lucy mentoring program, and as my career progressed slowly, I've found other people who I look up to and aspire to be like. During my internship, my manager is a very valuable mentor for me. He continually motivates me to be the best. And so are my colleagues who are senior software developers, they have such an impact in my professional career and how I develop into a programmer.

### 8. More meetups and tech conferences

Throughout the past year, I've made it my goal to be known to some organizers of meetup groups and societies around Sydney. Not only because I was job hunting but because I wanted to be around people who are like-minded. As a result I've been busy with organizing the Khronos meetups, but most importantly, attending and applying feedback with other social groups such as NodeGirls and women who code meetups. I've started attending Sydney Tech Leaders which is new to me and found this encouraging. 

### 9. Visited Melbourne

All my life that I’ve lived in Sydney, I haven’t fully explored Melbourne. So I finally took time out of my life to drive down to melbourne and explore the beautiful city. A weekend wasn't enough time to explore Melbourne, but I was happy that I drove down in my own car and seen the light of the city being so active at 3am on a Saturday night. Living in Sydney and having lock-out laws versus coming to Melbourne and experiencing 24/7 pho with alcoholic bubble tea was an experience.

### 10. Learning new things!

I finally learned iOS development with Swift! I won't say that I'm good at it yet because I haven't practiced enough coding with this but I'd say that I know the basics. I'm happy that now I've learnt the basics, I'm able to move on and build something more challenging later on, with guides from the Swift book or online tutorials without the stress of a class. I've also been working with Virtual Reality development, and the most easiest framework that I've came across was VRTK. If you're into developing some stuff for VR I'd suggest starting from this. 

### 11. Second place in a local hackathon

We initially are the first of the losers. Jokes aside, our team worked super hard on this. Although it was a local hackathon and half of us were experienced hackers who participated in other hackathons, we managed to pull through and make it happen. We had a common problem as university students: to find a suitable spot to study. We found there was an issue with the vacancy of classrooms or study spaces throughout UTS.

### 12. Got my face on some marketing material

As a part of my role as a SPROUT I was fortunate enough to be a part of some information booklets and material for UTS. This was a fun photoshoot and I'm super impressed with how it all turned out in the end.

### 13. Design

I initially was into coding and saw the aptitude to become a full stack developer. My mind switched when I have had a conversation with an experienced developer and he asked me all of these probing questions about my interest to be a full stack developer. He asked why I specifically want to get into front-end development and after going into a rabbit hole conversation, he suggested me to look into design and code. It didn't really occur to me that there was such a thing as creative coding and so, I have done a huge favour for myself: I changed my major from Enterprise Systems Development to Interaction Design. And to this day I don't regret my choice. My GPA dropped because I was failing some of the subjects from Enterprise Development major, but I'm hoping to see (and I have already seen) some improvement in my scores since I've changed my major. 

My mindset has now been focused on creative coding, data visualisation and user experience. I aim to be good at coding to meet the user expectations of the product, to become usable and friendlier. 

### 14. Co-opened a workshop

With my brother and partner we have co-opened a working space for mechanics and car enthusiasts to work on their projects and client jobs. Since May 2018, we have been working hard to ensure this workshop run smoothly. There has been a whole bunch of problems and obstacles that we face every now and then with this, and it has been a tough challenge for us. The huge benefit for us here is that we are learning about managing a small business, learning about cars and how they work and also managing people.

### 15. New job!

I applied for the Code Like a Girl internship program which matches female developers with companies that are looking for interns. I was very fortunate to be a part of this program and I'm currently interning at Data61 working on data visualisation project. I'm so happy here and I've learnt so much while working here. The team is friendly, open and filled with so much knowledge. To be mentored by leaders in the tech industry makes me feel empowered to do so much. Couldn't be any more thankful.

### 16. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency

When Bitcoin was the hype was when I was trading cryptocurrency daily. When the crash happened, everything slowed down and I wasn't as active on the market as I used to be. Since that crash, I was looking closely into blockchain technology. I was curious as to how it worked and how we can use this in our daily lives to control the future. Although my interests didn't spike up until I started my internship with Data61, I was always kept in the loop from being active on Twitter and constantly checking the market. 

### 17. Used a gun once

While on Holidays I learnt how to shoot with a gun. This was a super impulsive and expensive experience but paid off at the end. My scores weren't that great, however, the adrenaline rush from shooting the gun itself was crazy.

### 18. Starting this website

I’ve started this website to document my work. I found this theme to be helpful for me to first get comfortable with creating content and for people to easily find me online. I'm starting to work on my own Jekyll theme soon since this was very easy to work with! I've realised my posts have been lacking so I'm aiming to at least publish something each month - depending on how busy I get. 

### 19. Time management

Learnt the hard way of leaving things to the last minute. I've failed a subject because I didn't put enough effort in my assignments. I have found that I was the person getting carried in a group assignment because of my lack of time management. I found that I'm spending more time on my phone than doing my work sometimes and this has been a huge problem. Since I have put my phone on no vibration and silent all the time I've seen it less than it was when it was normally silent and on vibrate. I've turned off notifications on everything until I've finished my work, and I have also installed the news feed eradicator for Facebook. 

I've learnt to stick to a schedule - which sometimes work for me - because I'm a busy woman with a lot of responsibilities such as children, uni and work, I cannot guarantee things will get done but they eventually will. My tip: do not promise anything. No exceptions. 

### 20. Increased my social media presence

On Instagram, I’ve been making more online friendships than what i’ve done the past year. I've discovered more about my followers than any other year and I've continued to communicate with most of them outside of Instagram. Some of which are locally from Sydney and that I've bumped into at many meetups and conferences! Some of which I've added into the DEVANZ slack. I've felt so empowered from bringing positive vibes to everyone in the instagram community and never felt down about what I was doing which is great. 

### 21. Been offered opportunities that I thought I wouldn't get.

When I was volunteering for WiEIT and working along with the SPROUT team at UTS it both worked hand in hand with my interests: education and technology. I found myself really enjoying empowering other school students to pursue STEM related fields and study Engineering or IT. Through all of these outreach programs, some students come back to the workshops and some even stalk my instagram and twitter and message me about it! So I guess through all of these events that I was volunteering and giving people a raw image of what it's like being a women in tech, Wieit has kindly opened its doors by offering me to join them in Poland to attend a Women in Tech conference. I never thought in my wildest dreams to be given an opportunity to represent UTS outside of Sydney but this is amazing. There are other opportunities that I'm keen on taking in the near future, but this year has been the biggest for me yet. 


So this has been my year in a nutshell. I've made new friends, got out of my comfort zone a few times, learnt something new and being able to represent who I really am and my values on a world-wide scale has opened so many doors for me. I'm determined to make my year of twenty-two filled with memorable moments and successes. It's looking great so far, but I'm so excited to bring in more challenges!
