As 2018 comes to an end, I would like to dedicate this blog post to summarise the things that I've achieved so far, and the things that I've yet to achieve in 2019. I generally don't believe in resolutions, but I do believe in making changes for the better. 2018 has been the best year for my career, but the most terrible for my personal life. I have spend the second half of 2018 trying to make a bold move in my career as a developer while still maintaining the needs of my degree, all in all, I wish I wasn't so reckless with my personal life and wish I had known the symptoms before my mental collapse. 

**Warning: this may sound like a huge glo up on my end, but I just wanted to make it sound like I had a good year. **

## Talked a bit about taking a diploma > HSC 

For some time now, I was doing a lot of promotional work for UTS and as my job as a UTS ambassador. I took this role because I knew there would be a chance for me to grow out of my weakness and fear of public speaking and so I willingly raised my hand to do a number of talks this year. This particular one was my most favourite one: taking a TAFE diploma over the HSC. This was the first time that I was doing such a talk with a large crowd, and it made me write notes! I ditched the notes last minute and just spoke my heart out. At the end of my talk, parents and students were actually applauding me. I didn't really expect this because it was really my job, but at the end of the session, parents and students came up and told me how uplifting it was and it motivated them to find out whether IT or Engineering was really for them. End of the day, I worked out how best I can overcome my fear of crowds by doing this more often and as often as I can. 

## Volunteered for NVIDIA AI Conference in Sydney

This was the first time that I've ever volunteered for a tech conference. I had a lot of fun with VR, but in particular the NVIDIA Holodeck which is a VR tool to collaborate in VR projects in real time with multiple users on the same server. I've met a lot of people, professionals and learned a lot about the future of AI and ML technology and some current business opportunities with companies that apparently use AI and ML to predict things. I found this an eye-opener and the way into the future, which made me scared a bit. Overall, I liked this experience and would volunteer for another conference again if given a chance. 

## Took some 'me time' 

Took some time off to be with my family for the Feast and we went to Merimbula and had a blast. Reflected on how bad my health was, by staying in bed for almost all of my trip. I also took some time to meditate on God's word. Came back feeling refreshed and ready to end the year with a bang.

## Aced university assignments and tasks 

Finished all my assignments on a high note, got offered to showcase my project to other students and achedemics, but wasn't able to attend. I was able to finish all my assignments with good marks while balancing full time work and weekend work on the side, which I felt the need to celebrate and feel good about. Because this does not usually happen.

## Elected new president of ProgSoc

I randomly came to the Annual General Meeting where the societies host this once a year to vote in new leaders. I wanted a chance to redeem myself as a person and to prove to myself that I am able to be a leader, no matter how lonely I was. I was able to express the need for change in leadership in societies, explain some of the reasons why I decided to come to the Hackathon and reasons why I couldn't make it to workshops held by ProgSoc. All in all, my main vision was to make it an inclusive environment for coders alike to come together. I won by 7 points and couldn't be any happier and prouder of the team that I'll be leading with into 2019.

## Went to Europe 

This was a week on top of the tech summit I was going to in Poland. I went and explored a bit of Munich, Prague and Warsaw which was too short of a trip honestly! I saw real snow, drank the finest beer, walked into the walls of history in the castles and churches and enjoyed European culture and company. I had a lot of fun, and also met a lot of people - especially those developers who I met from the instagram community! [Peter](https://www.instagram.com/devspeter/?hl=en) from Munich and  [Matt](https://twitter.com/msojda) from Warsaw, bloody legends. 

## Went to the Perspektywy Tech Summit on behalf of WiEIT 

This tech summit was a highlight in itself because it was all about female empowerment. I'm very passionate with women in tech and bridging a gap between minorities in tech and the better half, but, what I've seemed to learn from this summit was a key message for mentors. To be a successful mentor you must understand who you are as a person and where you can improve at. As a mentor, you should have empathy toward the mentee and lead them to have feminine traits. I've also learned that there are roles that we all can play in the workplace, to be ally to young, new employees and to understand who the next champions are going to be. We all have to be role models for ourselves and be the future we want to see.

## Finished my internship!

When I came back I had two weeks left to finish my project on visual analytics. Managed to finish it with small adjustments that were made last minute, but it worked out well and I've learnt a lot. I've learnt how to use Unity3D, some games programming theory, graphics programming and fiddled and created a Virtual Reality dummy game. I have also learnt a lot about data structures and blockchain data. It was such an enriching experience and unfortunately I can't tell you all about this yet, but I am working on a piece that will sum this up with technical issues that I had to work around with too!

## Public speaking became more comfortable 

As I did more talks, workshops and talking to people, I became more confident in my public speaking. I didn't prepare notes for this, I just spoke my heart out and said it as it is. Most of the students were engaged and really asked the good questions after my talk. I felt that I've now found the groove for combating stage frightness and now my next goal is to pitch at hackathons.

## Living, Breathing and Letting Go.

This was a year of heartbreak, stress, working hard and neglect. I procrastinated on my health both mentally and physically. I was so drained by the time I finished my internship, I went on a total relapse and just rested. I needed this rest more than anything and just went to the beach, went out with my family, and then back to being sick again. For new years eve, I was actually just sick. In bed. I just want to be better in 2019, be better on the inside. I've learned to let go of my heartbreaks and moved on and reconnected with old friends. I've now realised how much I need to catch up with them and now I know that I don't deserve to drag myself through bullshit to win people's hearts and minds. I live for me, and me only. 

So.. there you have it. The other half of 2018. So what will happen with this blog? I'm going to keep it active until I finish publishing and fixing the next one. I promise it will be just as nice, and I hope that you will like it as much as I did. I'm hoping to create it from scratch and be able to share the code if it's requested. I really hope that you will find your happiness, be successful and achieve your goals in 2019! 

***Make this year count! ***

With love, 

Rosalie.
