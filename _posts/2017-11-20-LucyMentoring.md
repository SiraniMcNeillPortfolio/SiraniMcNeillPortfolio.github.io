description: Personal experience on the Lucy Mentoring program 2017
---

The Lucy Mentoring program runs annually and is proudly hosted by the UTS Women in Engineering and IT. This program caters for second-year students who are studying engineering and IT and that show an active interest in the industry. 

This year, 2017, I was chosen to volunteer my time to be a lucy mentee and was paired up with Kiran from Cisco. I had three ultimate goals to achieve during my this course. 

1. Get a tech job.
2. Know what skills the tech industry is looking for and how I can learn them.
3. Network, network network. 

Meeting with my mentor helped me define these goals and made my plans on how to achieve them. It was interesting how these goals have had little objectives in them, and creating a plan helped heaps. We had one to one mentoring sessions as frequently as we could. 

While I was a lucy mentee at Cisco, Kiran had shown initiative by inviting me to a weekly meeting called Cisco Mentor Me. This event was another mentoring program set aside for us that taught us how to gain confidence in the interview process, build up a portfolio and how to learn more about the tech world. 

## So, how did I achieve my goals? 

When I was initially job hunting, I had thought my resume was the best. Shown it to my mentor who had made a balanced approach and quizzed me on my skills. I knew then that my resume was too vague, and it was filled with unnecessary things. With the help of my mentor, I was able to clean up my resume and interview skills.

While attending the Cisco Mentor Me weekly meetings, I was able to discuss with the panelists about trends in the tech market, what skills to learn to be employable after university. Meeting with one of the managers at Cisco, he told me that I should be looking into Bots. The panelists also recommended me to read articles and continue my research into AI. 

I have met a lot of professionals working with Cisco, as well as meeting friends from other universities who also are participating in the Lucy Mentoring program. 

Some tips and tricks for nailing interviews. 
* Understand the role that you've applied for and the skills it requires. 
* Always overdress than underdress
* Research the company before your interview
* When answering questions prepare your an answer with an action that you have done then re-iterate what you did with the final solution. 
* Don't arrive 20 mins early, always stick around and come on time (at least 5mins before)

More tricks that can help you, if you're a student:
* Make the most of the project work at University or any other educational institution. 
* Use the time at University to gain more insight and knowledge of the industry. 
* Asking for help when necessary, donâ€™t stay quiet. 
* Make friends with your peers. 
* Make yourself approachable. 
* Do aim for high marks, don't stress over your scores too much that it puts you off extra-curricular activities. 
* Employees like to see you have a life, so do join in activities and societies that are outside your timetable.  

I would recommend this program to any student who is looking for new ways in the industry. For a student who is also seeking advice from industry experts, this is a great way to get started.
