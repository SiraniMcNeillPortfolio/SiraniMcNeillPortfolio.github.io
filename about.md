<p> Hello! I am Sirani who is a software developer focusing on blockchain and cybersecurity based in Melbourne, Australia. I enjoy coding and making websites with Ruby, Javascript, PHP & React in a functional, web accessible and usable manner. I prefer full stack development although my ultimate goal in my career is to be in a technical diversity and inclusion leadership role. Despite my many interests in technology, I also have an interest in diversity and inclusion hiring techniques and human design thinking for web accessibility. </p>

<p> I started learning to code as a mature age student at UNITEC Polytechnic in Auckland New Zealand in 2014 and realised that I wanted a career in information technology. Before that, I did qualifications in Business Administration and did an office administration assistant role at a medical clinic, but  I decided to switch my career goals because of my disability barriers. I started building my own Tumblr blog coding from scratch and this was a lot of fun as I loved creating the blog themes, images and creative content. As a child, I did poorly in Maths and Science but I loved learning about Computer Science facts in my spare time. </p>

<p> Currently I am interested in any sort of <strong> internship or graduate role </strong> or <strong> full time work </strong> in the fields stated above either onsite or remote. I enjoy doing creative technical projects which involves design and code. I am actively looking to work for companies who work for a purpose with mentors for self-improvement and people are experienced in diversity and inclusion. </p>

<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I was adopted from Bangkok, Thailand to European parents from France and New Zealand. I have a severe hearing loss and mild Aspergers Syndrome. Apart from learning online and coding, I enjoy travelling around the world and interacting with different cultures. At the moment I am learning Thai and German language; while trying to improve my Australian Sign Language and French. I also enjoy knitting and embroidery to relax me.</p>

<p> <strong> I got my theme <a href="https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo">here</a>. </strong></p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p> I've been experimenting with a range of tech frameworks and libraries and came across Gatsby! I'm in love with how fast and easy it is to use and host on Netlify. Before discovering React, I was into Angular and Ionic and decided to give it a go. It is still considered a dead project, but I really want to live it up eventually. I was also involved with other projects as well through small open source groups. Of which I can't showcase yet, because they are all in dev mode. Below are some of the projects I've been working on. </p>
