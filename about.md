<p> Hello! I am Sirani who is a software developer focusing on blockchain and cybersecurity based in Melbourne, Australia. I enjoy coding and making websites with Ruby, Javascript, PHP & React in a functional, web accessible and usable manner. I prefer full stack development although my ultimate goal in my career is to be in a technical diversity and inclusion leadership role. Despite my many interests in technology, I also have an interest in diversity and inclusion hiring techniques and human design thinking for web accessibility. </p>

<p> I started learning to code as a mature age student at UNITEC Polytechnic in Auckland New Zealand in 2014 and realised that I wanted a career in information technology. Before that, I did qualifications in Business Administration and did an office administration assistant role at a medical clinic, but  I decided to switch my career goals because of my disability barriers. I started building my own Tumblr blog coding from scratch and this was a lot of fun as I loved creating the blog themes, images and creative content. As a child, I did poorly in Maths and Science but I loved learning about Computer Science facts in my spare time. </p>

<p> At this present day, <strong>I am currently interested in work </strong>. I'd love to work on creative tech projects that involve design and code. I'm actively looking for work for companies who work for a purpose, that have impactful goals and that allow room for self improvement. I'm looking for Graduate roles!
</p>

<h3>Interesting facts about me:</h3>
<p> In my spare time I play video games, walk to places and binge watch Netflix! At the moment I'm learning Japanese as a spoken language and learning how to be a better photographer. I'm currently the president of ProgSoc and the vice president of the Interaction and Games Design Society at UTS, together both highlight my interest in social change and building a better university experience for people.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p> I've been experimenting with a range of tech frameworks and libraries and came across Gatsby! I'm in love with how fast and easy it is to use and host on Netlify. Before discovering React, I was into Angular and Ionic and decided to give it a go. It is still considered a dead project, but I really want to live it up eventually. I was also involved with other projects as well through small open source groups. Of which I can't showcase yet, because they are all in dev mode. Below are some of the projects I've been working on. </p>
